# 💠 Ubuntu Bind 🛅

**About IT** ➤ This command in **Ubunut Terminal** is used in order to bind a particular key or key sequence towards a readline function or method, or to set a readline variable. Regarding this command we have further different options to be used for its execution regarding specific purpose.

⦿ In other words, it allows us to change or display the key bindings, and these are associated with the key combinations that are pressed for performing specific actions over to the shell, where we used to run the commands.

➱ Let's get started having a look on its syntax in the most simpler way, in order to keep in mind for Ubuntu's Beginners.

```
bind [-lpsvPSVX] [-m keymap] [-f filename] [-q name] [-u name] [-r keyseq] [-x keyseq:shell-command] [keyseq;readline-function or readline-command]
```
