# 💠 Ubuntu command Command 🛅

**About It** ➤ Talking about command **Command** in **Ubuntu Terminal** may be a funny fact, but if we consider it properly or seriously, we'll found that this particular command is used in order to get some minor information about **Ubuntu's** other commands or to run other commands.

⦿ Remember that it is not considered at all and also it is not at all used in case of working with **Ubuntu Commands**, but if we need to understand its use, we must need to start using it. It can also be used in order to invoke commands on disk when a function/method with the same name exists.

➱ Let's have a look on its use case and command structure.

```
command
```

➱ Below we the default use case for using **command** Command in Ubuntu Terminal.

```
command Ubuntu_command_here
```

✐ Note : Remember while using **command** that, it doesn't works properly with all ubuntu commands in **Terminal**, do not try it using with each ubuntu command.

## ❇️ Optional Args in Command Structure 💻

| 🤔 **Options** | 📑 **Usage** |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| **-p** | ⤠ It is a path specified argument which is used in order to find all the **Standard Utilities** related to that command |
| **-v** | ⤠ It works similar to the **type** command in order to provide description about the command which is passed |
| **-V** | ⤠ Works similar to **-v** just with the difference of extended desciption about the command passed |

## 🔌 UseCase Examples ⌨️

🖱️ Below we have the directional syntax for using **-p** together with the **command** Command in Ubuntu Terminal 🔊 It will return the usage and working of it, if available it would return the working pathway of it.

```

🖱️ Below we have the directional syntax for using **-v**, as it returns the command name and short description about it, also you wouldn't get much ideas about the command on using this particular optional option here.
