# 💠 Ubuntu compopt Command 🛅

**About It** ➤ This particular command is been used in order to declare the variables together by giving them their attributes. By any chance if no name is given then it displays the attribute and values of all the attributes.

⦿ The **declare** command in its by default structure is been used in order to check the details regarding the methods and data that are been used or check the declaration of the methods and variables.

➱ By default without declaration below we have its syntax or keyword to be used for its initiation operation.

```
declare
```

✐ Note : Let's now get dive into further different information that are usually need to be gathered for any **Ubuntu User** regarding the usage of **Ubuntu's Terminal**, below we have different options and different args to be used for getting the data displayed.

## 🔌 Args for Displaying Declared Data 🖥️

✇ Regarding the data or declaration of the methods that we uses in our general usage we need to get them known at a place regarding the use and structure declaration of them in the Terminal and Actual data files. Also the args and information is been shown in the form of tabular data structure below.

| 🎁 **Options** | 🤔 **Usable Information** |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| **-f** | ❖ It usually displays the data after **restricting** actions or display to function names and definition. |
| **-F** | ❖ It only layers **restriction** to function names (together by the lines and source file at the time of debugging the code). |
| **-g** | ❖ It creates a global variable name only if it is been used inside a **shell** method, otherwise its usage is been ignored. |
| **-I** | ❖ It is been used in creating a variable name, and when it is used it inherits the value of the variable with its initial name and scope is also set to initial data constraints. |
| **-p** | ❖ It is simply used in order to display the attributes and value of each name. |

➱ Let's have an example here for getting the usage of these args understood.

```
declare -p
```

✐ Note : Remember these are generally used for declaration and getting the data displayed in the **Ubuntu Terminal**, we further have different args for getting more different parameter's information regarding the one already declared.

## 🔌 More Args for Different Information Gathering 🕹️

✇ Not just the one explained above we further have different args or options that are used in order to get different related data to be shown with the help of **declare** keyword while using **Ubuntu Terminal**, and in the similar way that is used above, it is been explained below **(In tabular format)**.

| 🎯 **Args** | 🔅 **Information regarding its Usage** |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **-a** | ✩ It is used in order to make an array with the provided names **(Its support depends on version to version)** |
| **-A** | ✩ This arg is used in order to create an array with association in its index **(User defined names as its Index)** |
| **-i** | ✩ It is used to make or create an array having integer as its attribute. |
| **-l** | ✩ This particular arg is been used in order to convert the value of each **name** to **lower case** at the time of assignment. |
| **-n** | ✩ It is used for making the **name** as a reference to the **vairable's name** with the help of its value. |
| **-r** | ✩ This arg or option is been used in order to make the names **read-only**. |
| **-t** | ✩ It works similar to **-l** that converts the value of each name to **Upper Case** at the time of assignment. |
| **-x** | ✩ Used in order to export the **names**. |

➱ Let's have a look on its usage or how to use these particular args or options with **declare** command in **Ubuntu Terminal**.

```
# defining a local variable here first
declare -I "Local_variables_name"

# converting that local variable name into lowercase
declare -l "Local_variables_name"
```

✐ Note : On using **'+'** instead of **'-'** will turns the given attribute off, or make it unusable.
